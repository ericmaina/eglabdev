		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p>Our group is interested in establishing the structure of plant gene regulatory networks and understanding the mechanisms underlying combinatorial
		 gene regulation. The knowledge obtained is directed towards using metabolic pathway transcription factors for plant metabolic engineering. Complementing 
		 our efforts to manipulate entire metabolic pathways with regulatory factors, our lab investigates the means by which products of specialized metabolism
		  move within cells.</p>
